**Full‑fledged Manager for VPN and proxies**:

Fixes Telegram MTProto proxies and **allows convenient** work with **TELEMT, MTG and MTPROTO.ZIG**, supporting most necessary commands:
Install, update, rollback, configure, edit configs, view logs, install and work with panels, get connection link – **without typing any commands**.
Also performs all needed functions for VPN panels/nodes.

⭐️ _One of our fixes [old V2 version](https://github.com/Mekotofeuka/MTPROTO_FIX_By_MEKO/blob/main/data/dictionary.md#Термины-связанные-с-фиксом) has already been adopted by TELEMT and Mtproto zig_ ⭐️

_MEKO currently uses the [more accurate V3 version](https://github.com/Mekotofeuka/MTPROTO_FIX_By_MEKO/blob/main/data/dictionary.md#Термины-связанные-с-фиксом)_

☝️P.s. there's also a series based on the fix ☝️
</div>



**The script solves in 1 click** the problem that appeared since June 4, **when Telegram client cannot connect to MTProto proxy server**. The fix is applied server‑side – clients don't need to install or change anything on their devices.

**Symptoms of this issue**: 
- Connection may hang, take a long time to establish, or fail the initial TCP handshake, followed by a **2‑minute** client access block after first connection.
- "Infinite update" on iOS,
- Media not loading – videos/photos/GIFs/voice messages/stickers.

**Tested on: Telemt 3.4.25, MTProto.zig 1.9.0, Mtg 2.2.8, Erlang mtproto proxy, MTProtoProxy, JSMTProxy**

This script is for servers with MTProto proxies; it fixes slow initial TCP client connections or complete failure (cannot connect to proxy). **Advantages**:
- Fast connection even with many clients and devices on one IP (Wi‑Fi)
- **Single port for all devices: iOS/Android/macOS/Desktop**, etc.
- **Media** loads at full speed
- Correctly detects and applies rules for different devices with **100% accuracy**
- **Installs in one click** with 2 modes: "standard installation" with configurable settings, and "automatic" installation that tells you what it will do and after confirmation does everything for you.

## Quick start:

**Attention, this script is paid; price: 1 ⭐ on the repository**

1. **Install/update from a reviewed local checkout**:
<pre><code>read -rp "Your hardening repository URL: " HARDENED_REPO_URL
git clone -- "$HARDENED_REPO_URL" hardened-mtproto-proxy
cd hardened-mtproto-proxy
read -rp "Reviewed 40-character release SHA: " AUDITED_COMMIT
[[ "$AUDITED_COMMIT" =~ ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ ]] || exit 1
git checkout --detach "$AUDITED_COMMIT"
sudo ./install_main.sh</code></pre>

Do not pipe a mutable branch into a root shell. See `DEPLOYMENT_VPS.md` for the hardened deployment procedure.
2. **Install standard Telemt**, or "**MTPROTO.zig**" or **MTG**
   > (all proxies can be installed via our script menu; you don't need to install them beforehand on the server, and order doesn't matter – proxy first or fix first)
4. Apply the fix to your proxy by pressing **[1] Install SYN FIX** in the main menu
5. **Disable built‑in MSS and SYN** from Telemt config by pressing **[5]** (if it was previously added to the config)
6. Check **SNI** via button **[7]** in menu, or via bot **@Sni_checker_bot** – you must select a domain that shows: 🟢 **Marker: NO**. Otherwise, iOS users will experience problems.
7. If you use SelfSteal, ensure your server has **OpenSSL 3.5** or higher – otherwise, similar iOS issues will occur. If you can't install **OpenSSL 3.5+**, then use any popular domain that shows "🟢 **Marker: NO**" instead of SelfSteal. Alternative solutions are described in the [documentation](https://github.com/Mekotofeuka/MTPROTO_FIX_By_MEKO/blob/main/data/dictionary.md).
8. Done.

- **Additional**:
Button **3** performs basic server optimisation for proxies – in tests it showed better performance: faster, more stable, less resource‑intensive.

**Open menu**:

# How the fix works:

Applies a set of rules to the server that splits devices into two types – **ios** and **non‑ios** – and applies different limits to each.

- **Layer 1** – Checks if the device is iOS or not.
  - **If yes** – keeps the device on layer 1 and applies rules specific to iOS.
  - **If no** – moves to layer 2 and applies layer‑2 rules for all non‑iOS devices, limiting SYN to 1 packet per 1.1 sec.

**More detailed description**

- Fixes dead connection issues on **iOS/Android**
  - Problem: mobile client goes to background, socket doesn't close cleanly, so the server holds a dead connection; when the client returns, it hangs on that dead socket.
  - The script makes dead connections break within minutes instead of hours. The client immediately sees "socket dead" on return and reconnects without hanging.

- Fixes **TCP** handshake being cut
  - The script limits incoming SYN frequency to 1 packet per 1.1 sec per **IP**, because the technical means limit TCP connections only if they exceed 1 per second.

- **iOS separately**
  - iOS has different connection patterns compared to Android and Desktop. Mixing them under one limit interferes with each other. Splitting by port is a workaround but clumsy. Our fix separates these clients based on iOS fingerprint, so clients of any device can sit on the same port without extra hassle.

- **54/minute** (not 1 packet per sec)
  - The **iptables** module **hashlimit** does not support milliseconds. 54/minute = 0.9 packets per second per connection (i.e., 1 packet per 1.1 sec). The extra 100 ms reserve eliminates errors caused by instant Reject, which otherwise leads to a 2‑minute block of your device connecting to the MTProto server.

- **REJECT** instead of **DROP**
  - **DROP** simply terminates the client connection without notification, causing timeouts (3‑5 sec) → retries with longer pauses → higher latency. **REJECT** with RST, on the other hand, immediately gives the client a reset response, so the client retries without waiting, resulting in much faster Telegram connection.

- **MSS** is simply unnecessary for this build, so the script includes a function to disable it. If you keep any MSS rule or config setting limiting SYN, media and download speed will be poor – so it's recommended to comment/remove such settings before applying the fix.

**If nothing is clear – go read** <a href="https://github.com/Mekotofeuka/MTPROTO_FIX_By_MEKO/blob/main/data/dictionary.md">Dictionary for dummies</a>, where all terms are explained in plain language along with complete documentation.

## Possible issues ("why might it not work?")

- The port/IP/subnet may have been **blocked** earlier and need to be changed (e.g., a proxy not working on **443** may work fine on **9443**). In that case, no fix will help.
- When using **v2** fix, which identifies device by **TTL + Length**, connecting from **iOS** – the connection may pass through load balancers, increasing **TTL** above the limit, so the script misidentifies the device as desktop/Android instead of iPhone, resulting in a block – in that case **you must use v3 fix**.
- When using the fix without **MSS**, **you must ensure that the domain used for Fake TLS supports X25519 MLKEM768** – you can check this **via the built‑in domain checker** or **via bot: @Sni_checker_bot**. **If the chosen domain does not support it – after an iOS connection attempt you'll get a block and the connection will fail.**
- **If you use SelfSteal instead of a foreign domain**, ensure that your nginx was compiled with OpenSSL 3.5 – **otherwise periodic iOS connection issues will occur**. For proper SelfSteal operation, install **nginx** built with **3.5** or upgrade **OpenSSL** on your server to **3.5** and rebuild **nginx**.
    - Alternative 1: use **caddy**.
    - Alternative 2: enable **MSS**, but then media will load **very slowly**.
- If you enabled **MSS** because your domain doesn't support **X25519MLKEM768** and you can't use another one, and media load slowly – that's expected. MSS reduces packet size, directly affecting download speed.
